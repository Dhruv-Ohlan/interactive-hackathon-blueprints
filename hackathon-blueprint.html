    <!-- Chosen Palette: Strategic Calm -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA uses a dashboard-style layout. The top section provides an overview and high-level comparison of the five projects. A central interactive bar chart allows users to visually compare projects by 'Winnability' and 'Feasibility' and to select a project for detailed review. Below this, a dynamic 'Project Deep Dive' section updates based on the user's selection, presenting detailed information in a clean, tabbed interface (Problem, Solution, Features, Market). This structure was chosen to facilitate non-linear exploration and direct comparison, empowering the user to quickly identify projects of interest and drill down for details without being overwhelmed by a long, static document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Project Comparison (Report Info: Winnability/Feasibility Scores -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Grouped Bar Chart -> Interaction: Click bars to select project -> Justification: Ideal for comparing discrete scores across categories, provides visual navigation -> Library: Chart.js).
        2. Technology Stacks (Report Info: Key Technologies -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Styled tags with icons -> Interaction: None -> Justification: Clear, modern, space-efficient presentation of categorical data -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind).
        3. Project Details (Report Info: All subsections per project -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: Tabbed interface -> Interaction: Click tabs to switch content view -> Justification: Manages content density, allows focused reading within a project -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind + JS).
        4. Market Opportunity (Report Info: Market Size -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Prominent stat card -> Interaction: None -> Justification: High-impact display for a key metric -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind).
